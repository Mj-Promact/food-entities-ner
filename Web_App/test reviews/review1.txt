One of the best places for Thai and Sushi, the staff recommendations were perfect from starters Sushi/Papaya Salad/ Soup to main course , do not forget to order owner special ( Bua fresh roll). We celebratated our anniversary and they surprised us with Thai dessert Mango sticky rice (So sweet!!). Very nice and cozy ambience.
