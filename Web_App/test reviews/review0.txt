Food lovers. I have to admit the Desert Bistro was enticing with it's beautiful setting,but be aware that the road traffic is quite loud for outdoor seating. Our scallops made a great appetizer,but my entree of vegetable lasagna was barely warm and tasted flat. My friend had the beef which she reported as very good. The wine was indeed good,but the dessert was mediocre. The service was excellent. I would probably not go back, however, as I would expect all to be good for the price of the evening.
