We came here for breakfast after seeing the bo ne (Vietnamese sizzling steak breakfast) on Instagram. I’ve been craving it since our Vietnam trip and I’ve been impressed. I was skeptical that the steak would be really tough and chewy but it wasn’t too bad. The flavour however was exceptional. This traditional Vietnamese dish is served on a sizzling hot plate with steak, onion, fried egg and pate with bread and salad on the side. The bread was really fresh and lightly toasted. I also ordered a hot soya milk which was delicious and not too sweet. For $17.50 it’s great value for money and I’ll definitely be back.
